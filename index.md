###Experience

####Teaching
* Teacher and curriculum manager of a computer science course at the Governor French Academy (August 2013-Present)
	* This involves daily leadership and education responsibilities for approximately sixty kids, grades 3 through 8.
	* My co-teacher and I also wrote and produced a curriculum designed to facilitate analytical and systematic thinking, while covering fundamentals of computer science.
* Research and development work on a platform for curriculum generation that involves generation of a curriculum, organizing prerequisites for a subject and developing a study plan for the subject. This project is still in heavy research and development.
* Volunteers time and expertise to the #Node.js and #meteor IRC communities on freenode
* Volunteered tutoring services in programming, 3D modeling and networking to various students

####Programming

_Proficient means I've been using the technology daily for a number of years and am confident I can learn new concepts in them in a short amount of time._

_Knowledgeable means I've worked with the technology for several projects but mostly use it on projects where it's applicable or required._

_Experience means I have developed with these technologies in the past but do not use them often enough to warrant a statement of proficiency._

* Proficient in Javascript/Node.JS, C, and Python, as well as HTML/CSS/LESS/Markdown.
* Knowledgeable in Wordpress, PHP Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord and Jekyll.
* Knowledgeable in MySQL, SQL, and MongoDB.
* Proficient in Photoshop and Blender 3D.
* proficient in Vim, experience in Emacs
* Proficient in Linux and Mac OS X, as well as Windows 

####Current projects

* Research and development work on a platform for curriculum generation that involves generation of a curriculum, organizing prerequisites for a subject and developing a study plan for the subject.
* An XML-based semantic markup language for rapid 3D prototyping using WebGL. Still in the heavy prototyping stage. Integration with the Oculus Rift SDK is planned (when I can afford one ;D ).
* Distributed networking architecture in NodeJS, for use in a hybrid meshnet-client-server approach. Involves a system which distributes data in a decentralized network of servers, which serve information to the client in the traditional client-server architecture. This project has been put on hold due to time, budget and experience constraints.

###Hardware
* Experience working with Raspberry PI and Arduino systems

###Employment
* Developer and writer for [Edufact](http://edufact.us/)
* Freelance Web designer ([portfolio](http://brianandconner.github.io/))
