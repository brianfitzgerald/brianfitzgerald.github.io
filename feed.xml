  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_packer&quot;&gt;Let’s read an article together.&lt;/a&gt; Don’t read past this line until you’ve read the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s starting to think like engineers. I think this is a natural reaction to interacting with increasingly complex systems on a day-to-day basis.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  We want the optimal way to get the most out of our time interacting with the world, and that instinct has been sharpened to a point with the sheer amount of this thought process the modern human brain has to go through. We spend hours finding the perfect balance between quality and price on Amazon product pages, we find and download apps and install software to make our jobs easier, and develop farming strategies in online games so we don’t have to spend money in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, our attention is drawn to those parts of life that are less-than-perfect, like ordering fast food, or checking our email, or renting a hotel. Except these problems are only significant to us personally, yet they’re the ones that require the minimum amount of logistic thought-power to to generate a solution. And the number of people who are able to take these solutions and turn them into something that exists is growing larger every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But humans don’t have unlimited interest or energy to spend. So big problems, problems that affect everyone, like climate change, overpopulation, and others simply don’t have any kind of audience from that demographic of people who have the audacity&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to tackle them. Because there’s much lower-hanging fruit, and it’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; juicy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s start thinking outside our personal bubbles, outside of problems that can be solved with big data, or with a storefront, or will appeal to investors. Because if there’s no one else going for the highest-hanging fruit, it might be worth going for&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It suddenly occurred to me that the hottest tech start-ups are solving all the problems of being twenty years old, with cash on hand, because that’s who thinks them up. -George Packer&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This isn’t endemic to technological innovation, but sure is a product of it.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this you’ve probably seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/september-resource-revamp.83018/&quot;&gt;this post on the roadmap for Planetside 2&lt;/a&gt;. At first I didn’t really know what to think about these changes, and the mention of a 25-page design doc behind it gave me visions of a needlessly complex and over-obfuscated system. However I’ve realized that the goals I want this game to achieve in the MMO space and what (I hope) this new plan will bring are more in sync than I first imagined. Let me lay down some revelations about the implications of this system I’ve had, and why it’s meaningful and important for Planetside 2 to make the changes I hope the new system will bring about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-gives-facilities-a-sense-of-role&quot;&gt;It Gives Facilities a Sense of Role&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this change facilities, for the first time since the game was released to the public, are more than structures fought over to flip a color and access vehicle spawns. Now they’re providers of resources, and each facility is an &lt;em&gt;asset&lt;/em&gt; to the faction that captures it, rahter than an objective. Facilities, I hope, will feel like actual bases of operation, with resources to provide and capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-gives-inter-facility-battles-more-diverse-flow&quot;&gt;It Gives Inter-Facility Battles More Diverse Flow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big roadblocks that classicaly were in the way of Planetside realizing the potential of its technology and direction, I think, were twofold: lack of flow and lack of meaning. For the msot aprt, the flow problem on a large scale has been addressed suitably (but perhaps not fully), but flow between facilities and the fights between them are still largely tugs of war. Don’t get me wrong, they’re fun for a while, but shouldn’t there be more to intergalactic war than pure zergfights? I hope ANTs wil give us enough of a deviation from the usual push-and-pull to alleviate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-keeps-the-size-of-battles-proportional-to-their-surroundings&quot;&gt;It Keeps the Size of Battles proportional to Their Surroundings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to assum that smaller bases will produce less power than large ones. If this is true (and it should be) then this fixes the problem of tiny bases being cramped by 1000 MAXes and instead keeps fights at the optimal size for what the designers of the facilities intended. This would be great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-notes&quot;&gt;Some notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#### * please, please, nobody likes waiting around either spawncamping or hiding in spawn rooms. There’s gotta be a fix for this.
#### * Also, a cert gain % bonus of like 5% or so for an hour on capturing a base would be interesting.
#### * Finally, the only way to balance fights with guns that are incredibly accurate at long range is to increase health enough to give us the chance to fight back, or at least find cover.
#### * Instead of bad textures occasionally, why not go for a more washed texture for some of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;there-needs-needs-to-always-be-something-for-players-to-do-to-contribute-instead-of-waiting-or-standing-around&quot;&gt;There needs, &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to always be something for players to do to contribute, instead of waiting or standing around.&lt;/h1&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Right now, the long-term survivability of Planetside 2 is in constant question as SOE scrambles to give meaning to the endless back-and-forth deathmatch that the game currently is. War isn’t a series of long engagements between wandering zergs; what needs to be established in order to bring order and a logical sense of metagame progression is a front line, and currently, this does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we create a front line without fundamentally changing the way the game works? The answers are in the game already, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make resources facility-based, not soldier-based: Right now, resources are almost completely broken. The only purpose they serve, to a player, is keep them from doing what they like- whether it’s flying a Mosquito or driving a Sunderer. In real war, it’s not the soldiers that have chunks of mineral in their pockets; what we need is a sense of a facility as something to defend, otherwise we lose the resources inside. It creates a more interesting tug-of-war that rewards defense and offense equally.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;So how do we divvy up the resources between players? I propose a cert tree for each type of resource- aerospace, mechanical, etc- and the more invested a player becomes, the greater share of the overall pool he can use (10%, 15%, etc..) This is also factored with the number of palyers at a station, so if 200 people are in one battle, the players with the most aerospace points are automatically given priority access. This solves problems of organization within large fights.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortification- Right now we have a flat flip time across all facilities of a certain type. This is not nearly as interesting a mechanic as it could be. I propose a ‘fortification’ system that activates defenses at a base (higher walls for no light assault, increased capture time, maybe even more turrets) whenever a certain amount of enemies are nearby. Depositing resources would decrease the number of enemies required to activate this state, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Level 1. 300 enemies&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Level 2. 150 enemies&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Level 3. 100 enemies&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Level 4. 75 enemies&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Level 5. 50 enemies&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bringing the fights out of the bases- Don’t get me wrong, facilities are some of the most beautiful places in the game. But I always remember the battles outside them- on a hillside protecting a sunderer under a bridge from advancing tank columns- the most vividly. Facility combat should feel like we are sieging a base, not hopping from one base to another. It should be the reward for a successful push back to the enemy’s walls.To that end I propose the following:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More sunderer upgrades. Make sunderers mobile bases of their own, with resources and upgrades to sustain damage or deploy teleport tubes, so they can hold the line more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make the facilities more spread out. I know this is kind of a big request, to change the map that drastically, but it wouldn’t kill the game to remove a few facilities, would it?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Players die WAY too fast. If gunplay is to be strategic in any sense, give us a chance to fight back from a sniper or an advancing column, instead of making it the game of whoever saw each other first wins. At least 50% more health and 25% more shield would go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consecutive login rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following this game from its announcement and over its lifespan the idealized version I had in my head and the real version have diverged significantly. Hopefully these changes will bring the visions I had of epic struggles over protecting a frontline to life. Or at least, it’ll incite discussion. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://roborovskis.github.io/images/money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the
six months that they need for digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my ﬁrst drawing. 
My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://roborovskis.github.io/images/sticker-mule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing Number One&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
drawing frightened them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a
hat?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor
digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it,
I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the
grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe — so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog — at least I had him for a few days until he ran away — and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college — one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “Yale News.”— and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York — and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the day it was announced, I’ve always felt a sense of loathing to the iPad. It’s waxed and waned over the years, as I see how how genuinely &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; it’s made friends and family. I concede that the iPad is one of the single greatest feats of user experience design ever created (perhaps the greatest). I even own a Nexus 7, for reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pikpok.rua2&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; articles before bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this summer I’ve never really had much of a reason to use Ruby on Rails. If I’m building a blog for friends or (if I’m lucky) clients I like to just set up a custom Wordpress theme, tell them not to touch it, and let them use the WYSISWYG editor that comes with the system. It’s a relatively hassle-free way of doing things that I only need to step in to if they need a logo changed or a column shifted over. But as I’ve caught the SaaS bug, and so I found myself setting up a RoR site, and as I ran a generator and saw dozens of files being created and having no clue what any of them do,I realized that &lt;em&gt;even though I have no idea what this strange and archaic-seeming system[1] was doing, I still felt like I was accomplishing something.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a conversation I had with a friend today, I realized that the reason I loathe the iPad like I do is for the same reason that I admire it: it’s complete, seamless. Everything flows, and it (almost) never allows any computing to seep into its sublime land of instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root problem I’m trying to get at here isn’t a tirade against all that is good and shiny. I don’t &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; anyone for using an iPad or iPhone; it’s a logical choice for anyone who just wants to get technology out of the way so they can focus on entertainment and communication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also not that iDevices are tools for mindless sheep. Lots and lots of very smart people love their iPads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think we’re hitting a point of diminishing returns with abstraction. Tech-savvy(read:curious) people don’t just sprout from the ground. It isn’t that there is a designated five percent of children that are sent to the School of IT so the rest of us don’t have to worry about updates and networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What bothers me the most, what really keeps me doing what I do, is the fact that creative and cognitive effort is being devalued by systems (and therefore, by extension, society) to the point that when it comes time to really dig deep and work on the tough problems, we just don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an almost unlimited number of places to put our energy and mind-space into. And inevitably, because we are only human, we want to find the best one, the most gratifying one per energy invested. Because that’s an essential part of innovation. But I feel like it’s been sabotaged, taken from us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all means, use an iPad, play Call of Duty, use  whatever. But please, for the sake of moving forward and improving, be an active participant instead of a passive one. Think about what a system wants you to do and how it tries to accomplish those goals. Because that’s the only way stuff gets done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] I’m not looking to pick a fight with any Ruby on Rails diehards. There’s obviously a lot of thought put behind every part of that system, otherwise it wouldn’t be as popular (or slow) as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] Also, don’t take this essay as a license to consume excessively. Ideas are only as good as the works they inspire.&lt;/p&gt;
