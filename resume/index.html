<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<h4 id="teaching">Teaching</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Teacher and curriculum manager of a computer science course at the Governor French Academy (August 2013-Present)
    <ul>
      <li>This involves daily leadership and education responsibilities for approximately sixty kids, grades 3 through 8.</li>
      <li>My co-teacher and I also wrote and produced a curriculum
designed to facilitate analytical and systematic thinking, while
covering fundamentals of computer science.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Research and development work on a platform for curriculum
generation that involves generation of a curriculum, organizing
prerequisites for a subject and developing a study plan for the subject.
 This project is still in heavy research and development.</li>
  <li>Volunteers time and expertise to the #Node.js and #meteor IRC communities on freenode</li>
  <li>Volunteered tutoring services in programming, 3D modeling and networking to various students</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>

<p><em>Proficient means I’ve been using the technology daily for a
number of years and am confident I can learn new concepts in them in a
short amount of time.</em></p>

<p><em>Knowledgeable means I’ve worked with the technology for several
projects but mostly use it on projects where it’s applicable or
required.</em></p>

<p><em>Experience means I have developed with these technologies in the
past but do not use them often enough to warrant a statement of
proficiency.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Proficient in Javascript/Node.JS, C, and Python, as well as HTML/CSS/LESS/Markdown.</li>
  <li>Knowledgeable in Wordpress, PHP Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord and Jekyll.</li>
  <li>Knowledgeable in MySQL, SQL, and MongoDB.</li>
  <li>Proficient in Photoshop and Blender 3D.</li>
  <li>proficient in Vim, experience in Emacs</li>
  <li>Proficient in Linux and Mac OS X, as well as Windows </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="current-projects">Current projects</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Research and development work on a platform for curriculum
generation that involves generation of a curriculum, organizing
prerequisites for a subject and developing a study plan for the subject.</li>
  <li>An XML-based semantic markup language for rapid 3D prototyping
using WebGL. Still in the heavy prototyping stage. Integration with the
Oculus Rift SDK is planned (when I can afford one).</li>
  <li>Distributed networking architecture in NodeJS, for use in a hybrid
 meshnet-client-server approach. Involves a system which distributes
data in a decentralized network of servers, which serve information to
the client in the traditional client-server architecture. This project
has been put on hold due to time, budget and experience constraints.</li>
</ul>
