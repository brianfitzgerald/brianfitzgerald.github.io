That would be Brian Fitzgerald, who does the following things:

* Teaches programming to grades 3-8 at a private school
* Programs Web things(preferably in Ruby)
* Ranting about programming theory (read: vague and abstract) in essay form
* Writing fiction, which usually turns out to just be essays with slightly more likable characters
* Makes ambient music (mostly for myself)
* Draws out elaborate cinematographic sequences in his mind for movies that will never get made

I’ve been programming since I was 8, and while I’ve used dozens of languages over the years, I’ve been working mainly with Ruby/Rails and Javascript/Node.js for the last couple years (with a little Lisp here and there). 

I recommend the following books:

* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
* Mr. Neighborly’s Humble Little Ruby Book
* Blender 3D: Noob to Pro
* Mastering Blender
* On Lisp
* Learn Rails 3
* Gödel, Escher, Bach


Things Brian Likes

* Bunnies
* Ruby
* Neal Stephenson
* The Avalanches
* Angular.js
* Dota 2
* Edgar Wright films
* David Foster Wallace
* David Lynch
* Planetside
* The idea (but not the execution) of Spore
