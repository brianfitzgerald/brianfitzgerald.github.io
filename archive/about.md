That's me, Brian Fitzgerald, who does the following things:

* Teaches programming to grades 3-8 at a private school
* Programs Web things(preferably in Ruby)

I’ve been programming since I was 8, and while I’ve used dozens of languages over the years, I’ve been working mainly with Ruby/Rails and Javascript/Node.js for the last couple years (with a little Lisp here and there). 

I recommend the following books:

* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
* Mr. Neighborly’s Humble Little Ruby Book
* Blender 3D: Noob to Pro
* Mastering Blender
* On Lisp
* Learn Rails 3
* Gödel, Escher, Bach


Things Brian Likes

* Bunnies
* Ruby
* Neal Stephenson
* The Avalanches
* Angular.js
* Dota 2
* Edgar Wright films
* David Foster Wallace
* David Lynch
* Planetside
* The idea (but not the execution) of Spore
