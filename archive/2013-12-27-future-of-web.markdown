Basically, the Web will follow, by the look of things, a structure that eventaully leads to a Morlocks and Eloi[^1] type scenario:

1. One half of the Web will slowly shift towards a system of APIs, probably using JSON or WebSockets or whatever data interchange format comes next. These will be the Morlocks- a grand network of software-as-a-service nd exposed APIs with minimal UIs that collect, compute and serve data.
2. The other half will be the advanced web application- applications that basically use HTML and CSS as a rendering layer, much in the same style as OpenGL. Javascript or other languages will act as interpreters that allow for a much wider range of freedom in structuring data and logic in apps[^2].

Think about the implications of a world where all you need to do to use a different methodology or framework in web development is write an interpreter for it! Data and logic structuring would be wide open to new thought. I'm hyped.[^3]

[^2]: The big example here is [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), although it's in a very early state.
[^3]: There are dangers that have to be addressed. HTML and Javascript need to be kept from becoming too obfuscated by elements that adhere to one methodology or another.
