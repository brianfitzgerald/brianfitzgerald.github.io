From the day it was announced, I've always felt a sense of loathing to the iPad. It's waxed and waned over the years, as I see how how genuinely *happy* it's made friends and family. I concede that the iPad is one of the single greatest feats of user experience design ever created (perhaps the greatest). I even own a Nexus 7, for reading [Pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pikpok.rua2) articles before bed. 

Until this summer I've never really had much of a reason to use Ruby on Rails. If I'm building a blog for friends or (if I'm lucky) clients I like to just set up a custom Wordpress theme, tell them not to touch it, and let them use the WYSISWYG editor that comes with the system. It's a relatively hassle-free way of doing things that I only need to step in to if they need a logo changed or a column shifted over. But as I've caught the SaaS bug, and so I found myself setting up a RoR site, and as I ran a generator and saw dozens of files being created and having no clue what any of them do,I realized that *even though I have no idea what this strange and archaic-seeming system[1] was doing, I still felt like I was accomplishing something.* 

In a conversation I had with a friend today, I realized that the reason I loathe the iPad like I do is for the same reason that I admire it: it's complete, seamless. Everything flows, and it (almost) never allows any computing to seep into its sublime land of instant gratification.

The root problem I'm trying to get at here isn't a tirade against all that is good and shiny. I don't *blame* anyone for using an iPad or iPhone; it's a logical choice for anyone who just wants to get technology out of the way so they can focus on entertainment and communication. 

It's also not that iDevices are tools for mindless sheep. Lots and lots of very smart people love their iPads.

But I think we're hitting a point of diminishing returns with abstraction. Tech-savvy(read:curious) people don't just sprout from the ground. It isn't that there is a designated five percent of children that are sent to the School of IT so the rest of us don't have to worry about updates and networking.

What bothers me the most, what really keeps me doing what I do, is the fact that creative and cognitive effort is being devalued by systems (and therefore, by extension, society) to the point that when it comes time to really dig deep and work on the tough problems, we just don't care.

We have an almost unlimited number of places to put our energy and mind-space into. And inevitably, because we are only human, we want to find the best one, the most gratifying one per energy invested. Because that's an essential part of innovation. But I feel like it's been sabotaged, taken from us. 

By all means, use an iPad, play Call of Duty, use  whatever. But please, for the sake of moving forward and improving, be an active participant instead of a passive one. Think about what a system wants you to do and how it tries to accomplish those goals. Because that's the only way stuff gets done.

[1] I'm not looking to pick a fight with any Ruby on Rails diehards. There's obviously a lot of thought put behind every part of that system, otherwise it wouldn't be as popular (or slow) as it is.
