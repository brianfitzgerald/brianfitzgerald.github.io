[Firefox now offers some sponsored sites in their New Tab Pages.](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-tiles-work-firefox#w_enhanced-tiles) After their Google affiliate revenue, this is the second method that Mozilla has developed for generating revenue from Firefox, which is othewise a free and open source project. It's always seemed, to me, to be a little at odds with the Mozilla ethos to gain most of their revenue from directing users to their largest competitor in the browser space, and I try to use as few ad-supported services in my daily life in possible. They seem to always dilute the experience of using a product or service. 

But how do you harness [half a million](http://blog.mozilla.org/press/ataglance/) users for revenue with an open source porgram? It's definitely possible. I propose the development of one solution here: a system where users donate towards specific features to be developed, towards a total estimated budget goal, out of several options that a development team can work on. I can't imagine this hasn't been done before, but I couldn't find any examples. So I decided to work towards a revenue solution for this problem.

A project's users are able to control the direction a project goes in, even if they can't contribute to dvelopment-- and this kind of involvement might cause some onboarding of new members if they become involved enough in a project to donate money towards its development. The funds raised might go towards salaries for top developers-- or possibly bug bounties for the project.

One difference between this setup and a crowdfunding project is that the goal here is simply a single feature or decision of a larger, already-usable product. The goals could be simply an amount of time spent on a project, rather than the promise of a single feature.

An example: Mozilla puts up a crowdvoting system to choose between developing an embedded e-mail client or a dedicated Oculus Rift mode. The Rift mode wins out, raising $1,980,000 over $1,080,000 towards the e-mail client. The people who voted for the email client are refunded their money, and work begins on the Rift mode.

In another example, a web framework wants to hire a full time developer onto the company. So they start a fund with too options: either vote to employ a developer, or vote to put money into a Bountysource fund. The winning amount is given to the more popular vote.



I've got a working prototype [here]()
