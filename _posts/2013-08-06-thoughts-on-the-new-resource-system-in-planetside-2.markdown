If you're reading this you've probably seen [this post on the roadmap for Planetside 2](https://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/september-resource-revamp.83018/). At first I didn't really know what to think about these changes, and the mention of a 25-page design doc behind it gave me visions of a needlessly complex and over-obfuscated system. However I've realized that the goals I want this game to achieve in the MMO space and what (I hope) this new plan will bring are more in sync than I first imagined. Let me lay down some revelations about the implications of this system I've had, and why it's meaningful and important for Planetside 2 to make the changes I hope the new system will bring about:

## It Gives Facilities a Sense of Role

With this change facilities, for the first time since the game was released to the public, are more than structures fought over to flip a color and access vehicle spawns. Now they're providers of resources, and each facility is an _asset_ to the faction that captures it, rahter than an objective. Facilities, I hope, will feel like actual bases of operation, with resources to provide and capture.


## It Gives Inter-Facility Battles More Diverse Flow

The big roadblocks that classicaly were in the way of Planetside realizing the potential of its technology and direction, I think, were twofold: lack of flow and lack of meaning. For the msot aprt, the flow problem on a large scale has been addressed suitably (but perhaps not fully), but flow between facilities and the fights between them are still largely tugs of war. Don't get me wrong, they're fun for a while, but shouldn't there be more to intergalactic war than pure zergfights? I hope ANTs wil give us enough of a deviation from the usual push-and-pull to alleviate this problem.

## It Keeps the Size of Battles proportional to Their Surroundings

I'm going to assum that smaller bases will produce less power than large ones. If this is true (and it should be) then this fixes the problem of tiny bases being cramped by 1000 MAXes and instead keeps fights at the optimal size for what the designers of the facilities intended. This would be great. 

## Some notes

 * please, please, nobody likes waiting around either spawncamping or hiding in spawn rooms. There's gotta be a fix for this.
 * Also, a cert gain % bonus of like 5% or so for an hour on capturing a base would be interesting.
 * Finally, the only way to balance fights with guns that are incredibly accurate at long range is to increase health enough to give us the chance to fight back, or at least find cover.
 * Instead of bad textures occasionally, why not go for a more washed texture for some of them?


### There needs, _needs_ to always be something for players to do to contribute, instead of waiting or standing around.
